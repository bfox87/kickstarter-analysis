# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Various analyses performed on kickstarter data to uncover any trends
---
Findings:
---
*Theater fundraisers are quite popular in the U.S. so Louise should not expect her situation to be unique. Additionally, more than half of all theater fundraisers are successfully funded.

---
*Donations for plays that were successfully funded had an average of around $93 per donation. Therefore, to reach Louise's goal of $12k for her play, she needs close to 130 donations.
---
*Timing of the fundraising campaign is important. Late spring to early summer offer the greatest chance for success.

Beyond Louise's commitments to the U.S. play, it is recommended that a more realistic fundraising goal be developed for her musical in Great Britain. Her fundraising target is more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal. However, the reason for failing to reach $ goals does not appear to be that the $ goal was too high. Therefore, further research into the reasons of failed musical kickstarters in Great Britain is also recommended.
